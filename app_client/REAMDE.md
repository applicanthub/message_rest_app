## Getting Started

### 1. Installing minimum deps
You can install Yarn through the Homebrew package manager. This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.
```
brew install yarn
```
If you use nvm or similar, you should exclude installing Node.js so that nvmâ€™s version of Node.js is used.
```
brew install yarn --without-node
```
Then from the root directory run:
```
yarn install
```
### 2. Start api server
```
yarn api-server
```
### 3. Build project with webpack
```
yarn build
```
### 4. Serve up the app
```
yarn start
```
### 5. Navigate to URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
